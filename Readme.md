## UC8 – Refactoring LengthUnit to Standalone Enum

### Overview

UC8 focuses on architectural refactoring by extracting the `LengthUnit` enum from inside the `Length` class and making it a standalone top-level enum.

This improves separation of concerns and aligns the design with the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).

All functionality from UC1 through UC7 continues to work without modification.

## Objective

Refactor the design to:

* Separate unit behavior from measurement logic
* Improve scalability for future measurement categories
* Maintain backward compatibility
* Preserve all existing functionality

---

## What Was Refactored

### Before UC8

* `LengthUnit` enum was nested inside the `Length` class
* Conversion logic partially handled inside `Length`

### After UC8

* `LengthUnit` moved to its own file (standalone enum)
* All conversion logic moved into `LengthUnit`
* `Length` now delegates conversion responsibilities
* Circular dependency risk removed

---

## Design Improvements

### Separation of Responsibilities

* `Length` → Handles:

  * equality
  * conversion delegation
  * addition (UC6 & UC7)
* `LengthUnit` → Handles:

  * convertToBaseUnit()
  * convertFromBaseUnit()

## Benefits Achieved

* Cleaner architecture
* Better SRP compliance
* Easier to extend for:

  * Weight
  * Volume
  * Temperature
* Improved readability & maintainability
* No breaking changes
* All previous UC tests pass successfully

## Technical Highlights

* No API changes
* No behavior changes
* Full backward compatibility
* Improved modular design
* Enhanced scalability

## Learning Outcome

UC8 demonstrates:

* Refactoring with safety using TDD
* Architectural evolution without breaking functionality
* Clean separation of domain logic
* Preparing codebase for multi-measurement support
